# Variables - We can create a new variable by assigning a value to a label e.g are as follows;

# name = "Alvin"
# age = 32
# likes_food = True
# eatsRice = False 

# print(name, "is", age, "years old")

# Variables can't start with a number and variable names should not be followed with special characters, it's best you use the nnaming convention above when declaring your variables.

# You can't use a keyword when naming variables, keywords are words that have specific meanings in python e.g are for, if, while, import, and, True, False etc.

# To pass the test on this challenge, declare the following variables - name and set it's value to your name, country and set it's value to your country. Then print out the text "(Your name) is from (Your country)"
