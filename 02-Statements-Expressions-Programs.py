# Expressions, Statements & Programs in python - 

# an Expression is any type of code in python that returns a value e.g;
 
# 1 + 1
# "Haruna"

# a Statement is an operation on a value, e.g are;
 
# greet = "Hello, world!" 

# a Program is formed by a series of statement like we have above. But those statements can be put in one line but must be separated by a semi-colon e.g;

# greet_two = "Hello, pythonistas!"; print(greet_two)

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to write a program that declares two variables (string_one & string_two) with string values ("Bannana", "Apple") & print the two variables, you are required to put them on the same line.
