# Comments - In the python language or program, anything after a hashtag is completely ignored, e.g;

# this is a commented line.
4 + 4 # this is an inline comment

# Programmers use comments to make code inactive and also pass messages in their programs to other developers who might be reading their code.  

# Indentation - Every line of code indented belongs only to the block of code that it is indented within, it is important to know that indentation is very important in python.

# To pass this challenge you are required to comment out the codes below, the first one should be a commented line and the other one should be an inline comment. 

# Your code goes below here
comment = "This should be a commented line"
comment_two = "The inline comment should say 'Inline comments are useful.'"
# Your code goes above here
