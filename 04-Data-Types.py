# Data Types - Python has several built in types ranging from strings, numbers, booleans etc. You can check for the type of a data using the type() function. e.g;

typeCheck = "What data type is this?"
# print(type("typeCheck"))
# print(isinstance(typecheck, float))

# in the example above, we are checking if the type of the variable and in the other print statement we are coomparing if the variable type is a string using the isinstance() function.

# Python automatically knows the type of data being stored, but you can also create a variable of a specific type using the class constructor, and you do this by passing the value or a variable name inside brackets. it can also be used to convert data types e.g;

ageCheck = str(3)
# print(isinstance(ageCheck, float))
# print(type(ageCheck)) 
# print(ageCheck) 

# below are some data types and how to check them

# complex for complex numbers
# bool for booleans
# list for list
# tuple for tuples
# range for ranges
# dict for dictionaries
# set for sets

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to declare 2 variables (string_one & string_two), with their values as "string" & 2.0, inside print statements, check for the data type of those variables
