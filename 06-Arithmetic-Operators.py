# Arithmetic Operator - They allow us to carry out math expressions in our program e.g;

1 + 1 #addition
2 - 1 #subtraction
2 * 2 #multiplication
4 / 2 #division
4 % 3 #modulus (remainder)
4 ** 2 #to the power
5 // 2 #floor division

# we can use the addition operator to concatenate string values. e.g;

greeting = "Hello," + " " + "Alvin"
# print(greeting)

# we can also combine arithmetic operators with the assignment operators. e.g;

bamodu_age = 13
bamodu_age += 12 # bamodu_age = bamodu_age + 12 
# print(bamodu_age)

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to declare a variable called (age) and assign it's value to the integer 18, then using the arithmetiic & assignment operator combined, add 20 to the age variable.

# Your code goes below this line
age = 18
age += 20
print(age)
# Your code goes above this line
