# Comparison Operators - We use the comparison operator to compare between different data. e.g;

a = 2
b = 1

a == b #False
a != b #True
a > b #True
a <= b #False

# To pass the test on this challenge, look through the following variables that have been declared, and give answer to the comparison statements.
# NOTE: Your answers should be in line comments, just as it is in the examples above

c = 4
d = 8
e = "4"
f = 4
g = "8"

# Your code goes below here
d == g
e > f
g != e
f <= d
# Your code goes above here
