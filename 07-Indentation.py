# Indentation - Every line of code indented belongs only to the block of code that it is indented within, it is good to know that indentation is very important in python.
# The colon character (:) is used to specify Indentation.

# option = input()
# if option == "Lead-Forte":
#     print("I go to school here!")
# else:
#     print("Sorry, I didn't get it")

# To pass the test on this challenge, declare a variable called (fav_food) and set it's value to an input function call, under that, write an if statement that prints out "That is my favourite food" if (fav_food) is == "Yam", else it should print out the string "Not my favourite food". 

# Note that each print statement should be indented inside of the if/else statements as shown in the example above. 

# Your code goes below this line

# Your code goes above this line
