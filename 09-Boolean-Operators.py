# Boolean Operators - Boolean operators are also logical operators, to check if a statement is truthy or falsey. there are only a few of them which are shown in the examples below;

condition1 = True
condition2 = False

not condition1 #False - checking if it is "not" true
condition1 and condition2 #False - checking if the first "and" second are true, they both have to be true.
condition1 or condition2 #True - checking if either the first "or" the second are true

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are to examine the following conditional statements below and answer them using inline comments.

checkCondition1 = False
checkCondition2 = True

# Edit code below this line
checkCondition2 or checkCondition1
not checkCondition1
checkCondition1 and checkCondition2
# Edit code above this line
