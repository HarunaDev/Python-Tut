# Bitwise Operators - they are rarely used but it's good to know what they represent just in case you run into a situation to use them. eg;

# & performs binary AND
# | performs binary OR
# ^ performs a binary XOR operation
# ~ performs a binary NOT operation
# << shift left operation
# >> shift right operation

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to refactor the following conditional statements below using the bitwise operators.

# You can challenge yourself by providing the answers as an inline comment.

# You can also review lesson 10 & 11 if you've forgotten about the "or" & "and" operators.

# Edit code below this line
"False" and "hey"
[] or "alvin"
0 or 2.0
{} and "True"
# Edit code above this line
