# Strings - A string is a set of characters enclosed in double or single quotes, as long as the quotes are the same on both sides. e.g;

string_one = "double quote string"
string_two = 'single quote string'
string_example = "please always use " + string_one + "s when coding."
string_example += " ;)"
# print(string_example)

# It is good to know that you can make strings multi-line when you enclose them in three quotes on each side e.g;

# print("""this 
#         is a multi-line
#         string """)


# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to declare a variable called (quote), and set it's value to be the text below

# Everybody taking this course should learn to program a computer,
