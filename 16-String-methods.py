# String Methods - You can perform certain operations or methods on that string. e.g;

#print("alvin".upper()) # to make all characters uppercase
#print("ALVIN".lower()) # to make all characters lowercase
#print("ALVIN hARUNA".title()) # to make the first letter of a word uppercase
#print("ALVIN".islower()) # to check if the string is in lowercase, it'll return either True or False


# It is important to know that string methods only returns a new string and doesn't mutate the original string. e.g;

string_method = "check this out"
#print(string_method.title())
#print(string_method)

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to perform the the 4 string methods in the example above on the string "lEAd fOrtE gAtE"
