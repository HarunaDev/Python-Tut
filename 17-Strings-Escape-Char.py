# Strings - Escaping Characters -- You can also escape certain character's in python using the back-slash \ before the cheracter you want to escape, what it means is that when you escape a character, it won't function as it normally would in python, but rather it becomes part of a string. e.g;

escapeChar = 'Let\'s eat, Dad'

escapeChar2 = "examples of quotes you can use in python include '', \"\", and \"\"\" \"\"\" "
# print(escapeChar)
# print(escapeChar2)

# You can also use the escape character for special formating, e.g;

# print("let's make a new line \nhere and \nhere")

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to print out the types of string quotes that we have in python

# Note: use the escape character for special formating and print each string quote on a new line
