# String Characters & Slicing - You can also get a specific charcater in a string using square brackets e.g;

stringChar = "Hello"
# print(stringChar[2]) # you can also use a  negative number to start counting at the end

# Slicing - This allows you to specify a range when trying to get a specific character. e.g;

stringChar += ", world"
# print(stringChar[2:9]) 
# inside of the square brackets you pass in 2 values separated by a comma, the first is index of where you want to start and then where you want to end.

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to look trhough the code below and answer the following statements using an inline comment

checkChar = "We love coding in Python"

# Your code goes below here
checkChar[5]
checkChar[-2]
checkChar[0]
checkChar[7]
checkChar[-2:9]
checkChar[2:11]
