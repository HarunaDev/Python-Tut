# Booleans- (bool type) This data type only returns two values, either True or False e.g;

done = True

if done:
    print("Yes! I'm done with my Assignment")
else:
    print("No, I'm too lazy")  

# When evaluating values that are not True or False e.g other data types, it's nice to know that any value that has something is represented as True and a value with is empty will be False e'g;

checkValue = 2 #This will be True because it has a truthy value
checkValue2 = "" #This will be False because it is represented by a False value of an empty string
checkValue3 = -1 #This will be true because a negative value represents a truthy value

# To pass the test on this challenge, you are required to check the following statements using the bool class constructor and type the answer next to it using inline comment.

checkValue4 = -70
checkValue5 = "-20"
checkValue6 = "0"
checkValue7 = 0
checkValue8 = []
checkValue9 = "\n"
