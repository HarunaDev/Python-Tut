# Variables - We can create a new variable by assigning a value to a label e.g are as follows;

name = "Alvin"
age = 32
likes_food = True
eatsRice = False 

# Variables can't start with a number and variable names should not be followed with special characters, it's best you use the nnaming convention above when declaring your variables.

# You can't use a keyword when naming variables, keywords are words that have specific meanings in python e.g are for, if, while, import, and, True, False etc.
