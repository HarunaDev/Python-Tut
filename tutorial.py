# Variables - We can create a new variable by assigning a value to a label e.g are as follows;

name = "Alvin"
age = 32
likes_food = True
eatsRice = False 

# Variables can't start with a number and variable names should not be followed with special characters, it's best you use the nnaming convention above when declaring your variables.

# You can't use a keyword when naming variables, keywords are words that have specific meanings in python e.g are for, if, while, import, and, True, False etc.

# Expressions, Statements & Programs in python - 

# an Expression is any type of code in python that returns a value e.g 
1 + 1
"Haruna"

# a Statement is an operation on a value, e.g are;
 
greet = "Hello, world!"
print(greet)  

# a Program is formed by a series of statement like we have above. But those statements can be put in one line but must be separated by a semi-colon e.g;

greet_two = "Hello, pythonistas!"; print(greet_two)

# Comments - In the python language or program, anything after a hashtag is completely ignored, e.g;

# this is a commented line.
4 + 4 # this is an inline comment

# Programmers use comments to make code inactive and also pass messages in their programs to other developers who might be reading their code.  

# Indentation - Every line of code indented belongs only to the block of code that it is indented within, it is important to know that indentation is very important in python.
